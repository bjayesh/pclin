Kamal,

here are a few things you should try with your new equipment:

1) Build an ebridge image using the instructions on the following page:
https://zoo.silverspringnet.com/display/FwEng/Building+Images
... using the following variables for the ebridge:
    export BSP=slic
    export ARCH=arm
    export PROJECT=nic
    export DA_RADIO=1
    export TM_SNMP_VERSION=2
    export MK_ENABLE_LUA=1

2) build net_mgr (under tools/net_mgr in your FW source tree)

3) Connect the ebridge to your laptop using the ethernet cable, and try to use net_mgr to get its node_age:

net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 node_age

xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx is based on the MAC address of the ebridge (found under the ebridge). So if the MAC address is 00:13:50:ff:fe:04:8c:2b, then the IP address is fe80::0213:50ff:fe04:8c2b%en1

4) Use the commands on this page to upload the image to the bridge:

5) Try the following commands on the bridge:
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 nodeq 0
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 nodeq 1
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 devinfo
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 sysinfo
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 trnet show device
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 trnet show route
net_mgr -d fe80:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%en1 stat nic_traffic

These give you information about the nodes the ebridge can see, and what IP addresses and routes it has.

6) Plug in the FSU and use the commands on this page to try to talk to the bridge using the FSU:
